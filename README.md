# Eat-Da-Burger
connect mySQL database and Express to handle routing

Introduction

You will create a burger logger with a homemade ORM (yum!), MySQL, Node, Express, handlebars using the MVC design pattern.

You will use Handlebars to generate HTML.

You will use Node to connect to your MySQL database and Express to handle routing.

App Summary

Eat-Da-Burger! is a fun app that lets a user input the name of a burger they want to eat.

Once submited, the burger is displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Every burger entered is stored in the database

Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

Setup and steps

This is how your homework should look like when done:

watch the demonstration of how this app works with this file in the repo: burger_demo.mp4
App setup:

1. Create an app directory called 'burger'

2. Make a package.json file `npm init`

3. Install Express npm package `npm install express --save`

4. Create the 'server.js' file

5. Install the handlebars npm package `npm install express-handlebars --save`

6. Install the method-override npm package `npm install method-override --save`

7. Install the body-Parser npm package `npm install body-parser --save`

8. Install MySQL npm package `npm install mysql --save`

10. Setup the following npm packages inside of the `server.js` file
    * express
    * method-override
    * body-parser
DB Setup:

Part One

    1. `npm install mysql --save`

    2. Inside your `burger` directory, create a directory named `db`

    3. In the db folder, Create a `schema.sql` file

    4. Write SQL so that it does the following things to create the database in a `schema.sql` file

        * Create the `burgers_db`
        * Use the `burgers_db`
        * Create a burgers table like the below instructions
            * `id` as primary key auto incrementing
            * `burger_name` as a string
            * `devoured` as a boolean
            * `date` as TIMESTAMP

    5. In the db folder, Create a `seeds.sql` file

    6. Put insert sql queries inside of the `seeds.sql` file to populate your tables with data

    7. Run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files

    8. navigate to the db folder in this app
    9. get into mysql
        maybe it's `mysql`
        or `mysql -u root -p`
    10. run this first: `source schema.sql` - this will make the database and the table inside of it
    11. run this second: `source seeds.sql` - this will populate the table with data
    12. get out of mysql by typing and executing `exit`
Config Setup:

1. Inside your `burger` directory create a directory named `config`

2. Create the `connection.js` file inside `config` directory

    3. Inside the `connection.js` setup the code to connect Node to MySQL

    4. Export the connection

5. Create the `orm.js` file inside `config` directory

    6. Import `connection.js` into `orm.js`

    7. Inside the `orm.js` file create the code that will execute MySQL commands

    8. Export the orm
Model setup:

1. Inside your `burger` directory create a directory named `models`

    2. Create a `burger.js` file.

        3. Inside `burger.js`, import `orm.js` into `burger.js`

        4. Inside `burger.js` create the code that will call the orm functions using burger specific input for the orm

        5. Export at the end of the `burger.js` file
Controller setup:

1. Inside your `burger` directory create a directory named `controllers`

2. Create the `burgers_controller.js` file

3. Inside `burgers_controller.js` file import
    * express
    * router
    * burger

    4. Create the routes for the app, and export the routes at the end
View setup:

1. Inside your `burger` directory create a directory named `views`

2. Create the `index.handlebars` file inside `views` directory

3. Create the `layouts` directory inside `views` directory

4. Create the `main.handlebars` file inside `layouts` directory

5. Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars

6. Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto

7. Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database
